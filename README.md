# Solita assignment

## 1. Prerequisites
The application is build into two separate directories:

- ### Backend:
The backend is built with JavaScript, Node js and Express js framework. You need to have **Node js** and **Npm** installed on your computer.Type "**npm install** " to install all required packages and then " **npm start** " to start the application.

  Note that the backend needs to connect to mongodb. In this case, you need to create a **.env** file in the root directory and add a connection string to the database.(The connection string has been provided to authorized persons).

  In this project I am using a free plan of mongodb. For that reason, all the datasets provided has not been imported to the database. Only the the following datasets were used in this project:

  - https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv
  - https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/726277c507ef4914b0aec3cbcfcbfafc_0.csv

  The data has been uploaded to the database using **MongoDBCompas** upload option.





- ### Frontend:
The frontend is built with JavaScript and React library. You need to have **Node js** and **Npm** installed on your computer. To run the application, make sure your backend is running. Then add a **.env** file in the root directory. In the **.env** file add this line REACT_APP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000 and type "npm start ".The backend endpoint is stored in a variable to make the application deployment easier.




## 2. Completed functional requirements and additionals:

- ### Data Import
 - Data has been imported to the mongodb database(Only https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-05.csv and https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/726277c507ef4914b0aec3cbcfcbfafc_0.csv has been imported because I am using free plan of mongodb and have already other projects using the same free plan).

 - Journeys lasted less than 10 seconds has not been imported
 - Journeys with distances less than 10 meters have not been imported

- ### Journey list view
 - All journeys are listed using pagination
 - When a page is selected, a fetch request is sent to get the data specific to the selected page.
 - You can search journeys using four options: **Departure station name**, **Departure station Id**, **Return station name** and **Return station Id**.
 - Top 5 popular departure and return stations with their respective journeys counts are listed.

- ### Station list

 - All stations are listed using pagination. When a page is selected, a fetch request is sent to get the data for that specific page.
 - You can search for a station by station name
 - All the stations in the database are displayed at once on the map.

- ### Single station view

 - Station name
 - Station address
 - Total number of journeys starting from the station
 - Total number of journeys ending at the station
 - Station location on the map
 - The average distance of a journey starting from the station
 - The average distance of a journey ending at the station
 - Top 5 most popular return stations for journeys starting from the station
 - Top 5 most popular departure stations for journeys ending at the station

- ## Surprises
 - UI for adding journeys or bicycle stations
 - Endpoints to store new journeys data or new bicycle stations. (This option can be improved by for example imprementing backend validation, automatically assign Ids, etc...)

 ## 4. Challenges faced

- Too large datasets to deal with expecially when using free plan database services.


## 5. Tools used

 - JavaScript, React, Leaflet
 - Node js
 - Express js
 - MongoDb(Mongoose)
